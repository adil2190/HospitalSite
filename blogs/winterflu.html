            An analysis based on re-tested throat swabs from people in Wuhan, China, and Seattle, United States, suggests that thousands of people who had flu-like symptoms last winter could actually have had COVID-19. <br> <br>
            On December 31, 2019, China announced a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, which later transpired to be the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19). <br> <br>
            The U.S. reported its first case of COVID-19 just 21 days later, on January 20, 2020. The person in question was a 35-year-old man in Washington who had returned to the U.S. 5 days earlier after visiting family in Wuhan. <br> <br>
            Understanding how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread in the early stages of the pandemic is important for a number of reasons, including accurately determining the fatality rate of COVID-19. <br> <br>
            A study led by The University of Texas at Austin has applied a new method to estimate the early spread of COVID-19, which is based on the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza cases. <br> <br>
            The researchers estimate that there were many undiagnosed COVID-19 cases in Wuhan and Seattle, WA, even before the implementation of lockdowns in these cities. <br> <br>
            The analysis, which is available in the Lancet journal EClinicalMedicine, suggests that the early spread of COVID-19 may have been far greater than experts initially thought. <br> <br>
