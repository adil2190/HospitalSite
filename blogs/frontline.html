        <p>Since its emergence, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, has become a global health threat.1 As of July 22, 2020, more than 15 million cases of COVID-19 have been documented worldwide, with nearly 618 000 deaths.2 In the UK and the USA, Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities have been disproportionately affected.3,  4 With ongoing community transmission from asymptomatic individuals, disease burden is expected to rise. As a result, there will be an ongoing need for front-line health-care workers in patient-facing roles. Because this work requires close personal exposure to patients with SARS-CoV-2, front-line health-care workers are at high risk of infection, contributing to further spread.5 Initial estimates suggest that front-line health-care workers could account for 10–20% of all diagnoses,6,  7 with some early evidence that people from Black, Asian, and minority ethnic backgrounds are at higher risk.3</p><br>
        <p>Based on experience with other respiratory viruses, consistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is important to reduce nosocomial transmission.8 Guidelines from the UK and the USA recommend mask use for health-care workers caring for people with COVID-19.9,  10 However, global shortages of masks, respirators, face shields, and gowns, caused by surging demand and supply chain disruptions, have led to efforts to conserve PPE through extended use or reuse, and disinfection protocols have been developed, for which scientific consensus on best practice is scarce.</p><br>
        <p>Although doctors and nurses—who earn a median wage of $105 per hour and $34 per hour, respectively—receive the lion’s share of public recognition for their life-saving role in the fight against COVID-19, they represent less than 20% of all essential health workers.</p><br>
        <p>Millions of other health workers earn significantly lower wages while receiving less public recognition for their roles, despite their sacrifices. Nearly 7 million essential workers are employed in low-wage health jobs on the COVID-19 front lines, including</p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Health care support workers such as orderlies and phlebotomists</li>
            <li>Direct care workers such as home health and personal care aides</li>
            <li>Health care service workers such as housekeepers and cooks</li>
        </ul><br>
        <p>Median wages across these occupations were just $13.48 per hour in 2019—well short of a living wage. More than 80% of them are women, and they are also disproportionately workers of color.</p>
