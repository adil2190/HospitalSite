        <p>A recent study shows that it is relatively rare for COVID-19 patients to return to the hospital within 2 weeks of discharge. Individuals with high blood pressure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most likely to require readmission.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many hospitals remain under severe pressure.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>To identify ways to relieve some of this pressure and improve patient care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, compared COVID-19 patients who returned to the hospital with those who did not.</p>
        <br>

        <p>All those included in the study were patients at one of five hospitals in New York City between February 27 to April 12, 2020.</p><br>
        <p>The researchers searched electronic health records for return visits to hospital emergency departments and outpatient clinics within 14 days of discharge.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Out of 2,864 discharged patients, 103 (3.6%) returned for emergency care. In total, the hospitals readmitted 56 patients.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Half of all the patients who returned to the hospital did so because they were experiencing breathing difficulties, which was the most common complication. Other complications included chest pain (6%), other pain (6%), altered mental status (5%), falls (5%), and skin or soft-tissue infections (5%).</p>
        <br>

        <p>Patients who returned to the hospital were significantly more likely to have hypertension (36% vs. 22.1%) and COPD (6.8% vs. 2.9%) than those who did not go back.</p>
        <br>

        <p>Surprisingly, say the researchers, there was no apparent association between the patientsâ€™ age and their likelihood of readmission.</p>
