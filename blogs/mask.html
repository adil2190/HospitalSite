        <p>As of Wednesday 22 July, people living in Metropolitan Melbourne and Mitchell Shire are now required to wear a face covering when leaving their home.</p><br>
        <p>At Alfred Health, we have measures in place to ensure everyone in our hospital is wearing masks to protect our community, patients and staff.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are visiting Alfred Health as a patient or visitor regardless of where you live, you will be required to wear an Alfred Health issued mask upon entry to our hospital. This will be given to you after your temperature is taken at one of our screening temperature stations.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You will need to discard the surgical mask you were wearing prior to this in one of our general waste bins at the screening station. If you were wearing your own cloth face covering, you can keep this, but we kindly ask you to put this away into your handbag or other concealed bag. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon exiting the hospital, you must discard your Alfred Health issued mask into one of the general waste bins provided at the exit points. You will then need to put on your own mask for your journey home.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Take a look at the video below about how to wear your disposable mask while at Alfred Health. </p>
