            “I was declared DNR – Do Not Resuscitate. The doctors didn’t tell me but I could sense it. I started crying. Physically I was unable to move but my mind was functional. A sense of gloom and anguish engulfed me. It seemed I would never see my children again. I was missing all my family and friends. I was thinking about the plans which won’t be materialized. I never thought of dying in a hospital alone. I didn’t want to be thrown into a grave by some unknown volunteers. This was not how I dreamt of my life.” <br> <br> 
            Abdur Rahman went through a life-changing experience in the COVID-19 unit of the Indus Hospital (TIH). He is the first COVID survivor at TIH. He is a 48 years old man and works for Sindh Police. Before the deadly infection attacked him, he was living a normal life with his wife and children. He was performing his duty while he caught the infection. He had high fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Luckily his family brought him to the Indus Hospital and he was admitted into the special COVID19 unit and his treatment started. <br> <br>
            He was admitted in the hospital for more than a month. During that period his condition got worsen and he was put on a ventilator for 22 days. At one point doctors decided to take him off from the ventilator, but something unbelievable happened. His condition started improving. His body started fighting the infection and gradually he became better. <br> <br> 
            The doctors, nurses, and other staff worked hard to save his life. His doctors say that he was a true fighter and didn’t give up on his will to survive. Once he became stable and his COVID tests were negative, he was shifted to the ward. Now he is in a much better condition and soon would be discharged. The month-long journey was not easy for him and his family but they believed in the divine and the miracle happened. <br> <br>
            He says, I went through immense pain and fear but I was lucky enough to reach the Indus Hospital in time. The hospital had all the necessary equipment and facilities to treat COVID-19. The hospital didn’t charge me a single rupee for the expensive tests and treatment. After the Almighty, I owe my life to the Indus Hospital and its doctors and nurses who literally worked round the clock to keep me alive.   <br> <br>
